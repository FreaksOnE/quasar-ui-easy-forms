If this helped you in any way, you can contribute to the package's long term survival by supporting me:

### [ðŸ’œ Support my open-source work on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/mesqueeb)

Be sure to check out my sponsor page, I have a lot of open-source packages that might help you!

(GitHub currently **doubles your support**! So if you support me with $10/mo, I will $20 instead!)

Thank you so much!!!
